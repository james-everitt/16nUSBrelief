Small 3D printed part to prevent disaster

Given that the Teensy must be directly soldered to the board, I was worried about damage to the USB port.
Simplest way I could think of to prevent the USB port being damaged when being rough with the cable was to 3D print a part to sit between the panel and the top of the USB port. It friction fits if you use regular headers, applying a constant downward force on the USB port.
Hopefully reducing the impact of any upward force that would otherwise rip off the USB port.

If the part isnt fitting, you might try resizing in the slicer software by 1-2% at a time
